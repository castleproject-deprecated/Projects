0.1.3 Preview 1 Update (2007-07-27)
===================================
- Fixed CONTRIB-49: "Wrong colorization"
  - Directive parameters are now only scanned for on the same line as the start of the directive.

- Fixed CONTRIB-37: "double clicking to select a word selects more than it needs to, or sometimes nothing."
  - All words and sets of spaces in all states are now returned to Visual Studio as seperate tokens
    when the scanner 'SplitTextTokens' option is enabled.

  - Each file now has a seperate NVelocity Line Scanner and Castle.NVelocity scanner.

- Fixed CONTRIB-45: "Implement a different coloring for non-syntax-colored sections"

    the Visual Studio XML editor.
