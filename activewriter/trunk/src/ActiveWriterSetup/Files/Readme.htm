        ActiveWriter Preview 4</strong><br />
        <br />
        ActiveWriter is a visual designer, an addin for Visual Studio 2008, to design a domain
        model and to generate code decorated with <a href="http://www.castleproject.org/index.php/ActiveRecord"
            target="_blank">ActiveRecord</a> attributes or accompanied with <a href="http://www.hibernate.org">NHibernate</a> 
        configuration.<br />
        <br />
        If you are familiar with ActiveRecord and/or NHibernate, this tool will make your 
        development experience
        a little bit easier. If you are not, be sure to check ActiveRecord's and 
        NHibernate&#39;s web site given
        above first, there are tons of information to begin with and a great community 
        to ask questions if you
        need some help.<br />
        <br />
        Please see <a href="http://using.castleproject.org/display/Contrib/ActiveWriter">using.castleproject.org</a> for the documentation.<br />

        Latest binaries of ActiveWriter and other ActiveWriter information is available at <a href="http://altinoren.com" target="_blank">altinoren.com</a>. Source code
        is available through Castle Project's Contrib SVN repository at&nbsp; https://svn.castleproject.org/svn/castlecontrib/activewriter/

        <br />
        What's New:
        <ul>
            <li>Added support for Flush for ManyToOneRelation</li>
            <li>Added partial Oracle drag and drop support. (Patch: Yavor Shahpasov)</li>
            <li>Generates metadata about properties to be used in queries (as in ICriterion selectCriterium = Expression.Eq(User.Properties.Name, name); )(Thanks: Rudi van den Belt)</li>
            <li>Contrib-30: Add flag to property to mark it with the DefaultMemberAttribute (or do it by default for primary key fields) (Thanks: Michael Hawksworth)</li>
            <li>Contrib-50: (Revised description) Allow user defined imports to replace generated imports. (Thanks: Michael Hawksworth)</li>
            <li>Contrib-54: Integrate NHibernateQueryGenerator into ActiveWriter (Thanks: Steve Degosserie)</li>
            <li>Contrib-81: Added list relation type. (Patch: Grimace of Despair)</li>
            <li>Moved all to vS2008</li>
            <li>Moved binaries license from &quot;as is&quot; to Apache v2. We don&#39;t need DSL Tools 
                redistributables in setup package anymore.</li>
        </ul>
        Fixed:
        <ul>
            <li>ManyToOne SourceNotNull is now working propertly</li>
            <li>Incorrectly generates Some pascal case fields as camel case.</li>
            <li>Contrib-52: (Revised description) Generic types are incorrectly generated if the given type name already includes generic parameters. (Thanks: Hugo Burm)</li>
            <li>CONTRIB-59: (Revised description) Problems with NHQG integration when the temporary path, used for out argument, contains spaces. (Patch: Steve Degosserie)</li>
            <li>Contrib-56: When creating a many-one relation, the generation of the Ilist should always be generic, independent of the generic settings for the objects. (Thanks: Robert van Hoornaar)</li>
            <li>Contrib-61: (If the namespace cannot be retrieved from the VS project system) When a class is added to a model, the .hbm.xml file that is added as a nested file is missing the first character of the class name in the filename. (Thanks: David Gardiner)</li>
            <li>Contrib-63: VB projects can have a default root Namespace. ActiveWriter should take this into account when generating the mapping files. It currently appears to only use the model's Namespace property. (Patch: David Gardiner)</li>
            <li>Contrib-66: The private field used by the relation properties should be initialised with a constructor (Patch: David Gardiner) (Added as a model level option, defaults to false)</li>
            <li>Contrib-69: Generated VB code should respect project's Option Strict setting (Patch: David Gardiner)</li>
            <li>Contrib-70: Using a custom type that is defined in a user project fails (Partial patch: David Gardiner)</li>
            <li>Contrib-72: Option to remove prefix from generated property names.(Patch: David Gardiner) (Implemented as model level RegEx)</li>
            <li>Contrib-73: Look for Castle.ActiveWriter and NHibernate in project references. (Patch: David Gardiner)</li>
            <li>Oracle support is now fully working (Patch: Marjan Flis)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Preview 2 Release - 18/03/2007<br />
            <br />
        </strong>What's new:<br />
        <ul>
            <li>Built with VS SDK v4.</li>
            <li>Generics support (ActiveRecordBase<t></t>
                &amp; ActiveRecordValidationBase<t></t>) (Generics is the default in the designer)
            </li>
            <li>VB.NET seems OK (Not tested extensively). </li>
            <li>Auto-sensing project type (C# or VB.NET) for code generation. You don't have to
                set that in the model anymore. </li>
            <li>New ActiveWriter Class Details toolwindow. Can be used for rapidly adding class
                properties. (Idea: Ayende) </li>
            <li>AR validators are supported for each property (not for field, key, composite key,
                timestamp or version) through a designer. </li>
            <li>Ability to customize the base class. You can substitude your own base class from
                the editor or generate classes without a base class. </li>
            <li>Ability to customize the source property name for associations. This is necessary
                for hierarchical objects, where they point to themselves, and using the class name
                resulted in un-compilable code in previous build. (Reported By: Ayende) </li>
            <li>More domain consistency check through validations when opening / saving. </li>
            <li>Applying pluralizing rules to the table name from the entity name if not specified.
                (Idea: Ayende) </li>
            <li>Ability to select a property for optional DebuggerDisplay attribute. </li>
            <li>Ability to decorate classes with GeneratedCodeAttribute. </li>
            <li>No more setting Custom Tool property of an .actiw file to ActiveWriterCodeGenerator
                manually after creating the file. It's done automatically. (Thanks: Bogdan Pietroiu)
            </li>
            <li>Key icon decorator on class shapes if a primary or composite key property exists
                (pure cosmetic). </li>
            <li>Key icon decorator on class shapes if at least a property has validator(s) set (pure
                cosmetic). </li>
            <li>Connector shapes changed to a more-UML-like notation. </li>
            <li>Extended nullable support. You may choose between nullables through external Nullables
                library (1.1 style) or native nullables usage of 2.0 framework. </li>
            <li>Some added properties to support changes (not all) in Castle trunk for ActiveRecordAttribute,
                PropertyAttribute etc. </li>
        </ul>
        What's crippled:<br />
        <ul>
            <li> Using Output window less when doing drag-drop from Server Explorer to prevent
                a bug.</li>
        </ul>
